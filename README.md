# Analysis of a collaborative research network of Botulinum Toxin clinical trials
This repository contains data for the paper "Analysis of a collaborative research network of Botulinum Toxin clinical trials".

## Overview
Recently, pharmaceutical companies have been striving to occupy the global market, and clinical research has been actively conducted through mutual col-
laboration networks. In particular, the international Botulinum toxin (BT) market is characterized by intensifying competition. The majority of BT research was conducted
in the United States and Europe, while various countries started their regional research through international collaboration networks.
With this trend, we aimed to examine the current collaboration trend and network of clinical trial research in BT research by employing both bibliometric and collaboration network analyses with one of the global academic and research databases.
